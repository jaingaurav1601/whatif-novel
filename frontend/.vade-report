Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

This implementation adds Vercel Web Analytics to the whatif-novel frontend project using the App Router configuration.

Changes Made:

1. Installed Package:
   - Added @vercel/analytics (^1.6.1) as a dependency via npm

2. Modified Files:
   - frontend/app/layout.js
     * Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
     * Added `<Analytics />` component inside the <body> tag, after {children}
     * This ensures analytics are collected for all routes in the App Router application

3. Updated Lock Files:
   - package-lock.json - Updated to reflect the new dependency and its transitive dependencies

Implementation Details:

- The project uses Next.js 16.1.1 with App Router (app directory structure)
- @vercel/analytics is installed as version ^1.6.1 and includes all necessary dependencies
- The Analytics component is placed in the root layout to ensure it's loaded on every page
- No breaking changes to existing code; only additions were made

Verification Completed:

✓ Build verification: `npm run build` completed successfully with all pages pre-rendered as static content
✓ Linting check: app/layout.js passes ESLint validation with no errors
✓ No test files exist in the project
✓ All changes are properly staged for commit

The implementation follows Vercel's best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing Next.js application.
